# Handegg
Handegg (football simulation) to be used as backend of a browser game

This is an early build of what will be a browser game that simulates fictional college football games.

Concept:
- project will be structured so that each team is made of 23 to 46 players
- players are to be randomized by the code once then saved to file for import when program is first executed
- methods within the player class will build the appropriate number of players at each position for each team
- Games will be simulated on a timer that prints out play-by-play in browser
- Users can interact with the games through a fantasy football type system, where they choose a team to follow and get points for wins
- eventually users will be able to "draft" individual players off of any team exactly like fantasy football
